      <p>What will happen when AI advances in the next few years? Will it take away jobs from citizens? When we view future artists' works, will they convey meaningful messages effectively? Or am I overthinking this, and will the internet ultimately help the world grow as a community? These are recurring questions I ask myself about the future of the internet in the next 50 to 100 years. 
      </p><p>
        <br>
          As everyone knows, the internet is constantly evolving and collecting data about us to understand our behavior, likes and dislikes, hobbies, music preferences, trends, and more. Additionally, the internet is a resource where we can seek assistance from AI to answer questions or help with creative endeavors. 
      </p><p>
          <br>
          However, that's a deeper topic for another time. For now, it's important to recognize that the internet can also shed light on critical issues such as poverty, war, political challenges, school shootings, protests, animal cruelty, and kidnapping. The internet isn’t always as negative as people often portray it. 
      </p><p>
      <br>
          In my opinion, the future of the internet depends on its users; it can either take a positive or negative turn in the coming years.
      </p><p>
          <br>
          I’ll start by discussing the wrong ways to use the internet. One major issue is spreading misinformation on various topics, which includes stealing art, creating AI-generated works, falling for scams, and engaging in cyberbullying, among others. There are countless aspects of improper internet use, but I want to highlight two examples that resonate with me.
      </p><p>
          <br>
          In September, I attended an exhibition by an artist named Stephanie Dinkins. Her exhibit focused on the significance of okras in her heritage and the role of AI in expressing her vision. However, when I visited with my classmates, we all felt that the exhibition featured more AI than the cultural narrative about her people and the importance of okra that she aimed to convey. 
      </p><p>
          <br>
          My classmates struggled to embrace the idea of using AI in art, primarily because it has been displacing many artists and stifling creativity. At times, it's difficult to discern whether a piece is the result of human talent or a machine's output. In my opinion, the use of AI was excessive in this exhibition, making it challenging to grasp the artist’s intended message. For instance, during the slideshow she presented, there were noticeable errors where AI altered the colors representing her culture, which detracted from her vision.
      </p><p>
          <br>
          This experience highlights my concerns about the internet. While people now have access to AI that allows them to create art, it often lacks the depth of talent that was more prevalent in earlier years. Many individuals are so reliant on technology that they struggle to produce art themselves.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          My second issue with the internet is the widespread misinformation often shared through social media and other online platforms. It can be challenging to identify and eliminate all of this misinformation, given its vast presence. According to a recent article by <a href="https://worldmetrics.org/misinformation-statistics/"> WorldMetrics,</a> about 59% of Americans admitted to sharing fake news. Alarmingly, around 70% of this misinformation is disseminated on Twitter. Additionally, 41% of Americans shared fake news even when the stories didn’t make sense.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          When it comes to critical events, such as elections, the situation is even more concerning—70% of individuals share fake news rather than factual information. Furthermore, 29% of Americans reported changing their votes after encountering misinformation. Research indicates that misinformation spreads 70% faster and farther than accurate information, meaning that Americans are more likely to come across false narratives than the truth.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          A small percentage of users are responsible for spreading 80% of the misinformation, often for framing or other purposes. Notably, 52% of vaccine hesitancy is linked to the spread of misinformation. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, 70% of false news stories outperformed factual news. Additionally, 28% of Americans were misled during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      </p><p>
      <br>
          Only 26% of Americans feel confident in their ability to spot false news, indicating that about 72% cannot identify misinformation, which is concerning. Each instance of false information damages the communities people try to build, leading to distrust and unnecessary conflict that should not exist in the first place.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          The internet has both positive and negative aspects. Those with internet access have created funds to support individuals living in poverty or affected by war. Activists use the platform to raise awareness about serious issues, share recipes on social media, provide solutions for those in need, and disseminate health information related to various diseases. People look out for one another because they have the power to do so through the internet. We, as a community, do not want to witness the suffering of others. Therefore, I would like to highlight the positive side of the internet.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          One example that illustrates this is from an article I recently read titled <a href="https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets"> "The Library of Missing Datasets"</a> by Mimi Onuoha. This art installation features a file cabinet filled with folders labeled with data about political injustice and marginalized or vulnerable groups. When you open a folder, you find it empty, symbolizing how many injustices are overlooked and under-discussed. The folders represent vital information, such as global web user statistics that consider VPNs, public lists of citizens on domestic surveillance lists, and the number of Americans without bank accounts in 2000, among others.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          Many injustices occur that go unnoticed by the public, but Mimi Onuoha is determined to bring them to light. Through her work, she aims to show the vast amount of critical information that remains hidden and the issues faced by vulnerable populations. Many others like her are also using the internet to shed light on unfortunate circumstances and advocate for change.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          My second reason why the internet can grow healthily is the ability it provides for people to create fundraisers for those in desperate need of help. Numerous websites have been established for this purpose, with GoFundMe being the most prominent. GoFundMe allows individuals to share their struggles online and receive support from those who empathize with their situations.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          For example, there is currently a war happening in Gaza, where many Palestinians face daily threats. A majority of people sympathize with their plight, which is why a British artist named Brian Eno organized a fundraiser called <a href="https://borgenproject.org/together-for-palestine-fundraiser/"> "Together for Palestine."</a> This initiative encourages individuals to donate whatever amount they can to help provide Palestinians with food, water, shelter, and security. According to an article I found, the fundraiser aims to raise $2 million to aid Gaza, and thus far, they have collected $1.8 million. I am confident that more support will come in to help them reach their goal.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          Additionally, people are organizing concerts, with 200,000 attendees streaming the events, ensuring that the ongoing situation in Gaza is not forgotten. If they were in that position, they would hope for similar aid. This illustrates my point about the positive potential of the internet; it enables those in a position to help to reach out and assist others in danger, as we witness in this current crisis.
          In conclusion, the future of the internet over the next 50 to 100 years will depend largely on the people who have access to it. While there are negative aspects to the internet—such as the rise of AI-generated art, which diminishes the value of traditional hand-crafted art, and the spread of misinformation that erodes trust among individuals—there are also positive aspects. For example, the internet can raise awareness about critical issues facing marginalized groups and enable people to organize fundraisers for those in need, whether individuals or entire countries.
      </p><p>
      <br>
          Ultimately, the internet's future is uncertain, and it can be shaped for better or worse by its users. I hope that people will make thoughtful choices and continue to foster a sense of community that ensures prosperity for future generations.
