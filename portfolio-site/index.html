      <!-- Start content edits below this line. -->
      <p>I currently live in the Bay Area, where I am completing my bachelor's degree in digital media art at San Jose State University. I plan to graduate in the spring of 2026. I specialize in various arts, including traditional, digital, video, and coding. Each piece of art I create is inspired by different experiences, whether walking outside, attending class, or talking to a friend. <br>
        Growing up, creating art was never my dream career; I initially wanted to become a kindergarten teacher. However, everything changed when a friend began complimenting another person's artwork. Feeling envious, I started drawing repeatedly, hoping to create the perfect piece to earn me similar compliments. I know that makes me sound selfish, but it was a goal I wanted to reach. Ultimately, I gave up on that goal because I realized I wanted to draw for myself. I aspired to create art like an animator and bring my work to life. This exploration led me to discover a talent I never knew I had, prompting me to change my career path and focus on art, still wanting to make my creations come alive.</p>
