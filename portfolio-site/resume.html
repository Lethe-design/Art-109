          <h3>Code BMO</h3>
          <p>This was my first experience creating a character through coding. Although it's a relatively simple piece of code, I had a great time bringing this famous character to life and experimenting with coding in this way.</p>

          <h3>Snoopy</h3>
          <p>I won't say this was entirely my first time working with code and creating a website because it isn't. However, it was challenging to create one again since the last time I built a website was back in high school, around four years ago. Additionally, making the rollover or clickable regions was just as difficult because this was the first time I had manipulated code in this way. There was so much to learn in just a few days of being in class Art 101, and my brain struggled to keep up. Nevertheless, with a little help, I created a decent code that I am quite proud of.
          <br>And if you were curious as to where my clickable regions are, check at these 5 places and you'll find it.</p>
